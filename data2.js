I wanted text that *felt* voiced, without interjecting myself into content focused on another channel. Something like to animalese felt right, so I threw this project together.\n\nIt types out text and tries to pronounce phonemes it can match, has support for a lot of arguments for how the text is displayed, enough to give the text some character, and flow somewhat like speech.\n\n[demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw6i6e7WPUo)  \nthat video's script:\n```\nvar texts2 = [\n\t\"$$f3Realizing I never demoed this since changing a lot.$$y9$$f4 So here's that-$$y9$$a\",  # Frame rate and delay demonstration\n\t\"$$f2You can change the text speed,$$y3 or $$stoggle slow mode$$s,$$y3 which just advances every third character$$y9$$a\",  # Slow mode demonstration\n\t\"$$f4These$$y3 pauses$$y3 exist.$$y9$$a\",  # Wait command demonstration\n\t\"$$f3I like this keypress sound$$f6$$y3$$v$$v$$v$$f3$$y5\\n$$a\",\n\t\"$$nProbably too much$$f6$$y3$$v$$v$$v$$y9$$a\",  # Keypress sound demonstration\n\t\"$$f3You can delete charatcers:$$y5$$d$$y3$$d$$y2$$d$$d$$d$$d$$y2cters kinda like that$$v$$y9$$a\",  # Delete command demonstration\n\t\"$$f3manually clearing$$cthe textbox$$v$$y9$$a\",  # Clear command demonstration\n\t\"$$f3Advance text one line at a time:$$y9 \\nLine 1$$v$$y3\\n$$nLine 2$$v$$y3\\n$$nLine 3$$v$$y9$$a\",  # Advance one line demonstration\n\t\"$$f3Setting a new $$f1frame rate mid-line$$v$$y3$$f7\\nhowever many$$f2 times $$f1you want$$v$$y9$$a\",  # Frame rate change demonstration\n\t\"$$f3You can also just,$$y3 not auto-advance the text if you want$$v\",\n\t\"or even rudely interrupt me before $$f5I say fuck at you\",\n\t\"OH!

Formatting is somewhat easily embedded within, with commands.\n\n```\n# Command List:\n# $$y#: Waits for a specified number of characters (#) before continuing.\n# $$s: toggles Slow mode (printing every 3rd character)\n# $$a: Advance to the next textbox\n# $$n: deletes textbox up to the first Newline character (advance text 1 line)  eg: $$n\\n\n# $$c: Clears the textbox\n# $$d: Deletes the last char\n# $$v: plays a keypress sound and types a period. idk, d for dot was taken.\n# $$f#: set Frames per char. range 1-9, default 4\n```\n\nCurrently, it works. The code's messy in places, but it does what I needed it to. I might clean it up if I reuse this again, but I've changed format enough that I doubt that'll be any time soon.\n\nGotta say, I do enjoy how much use I've gotten out of those tiling shaders.\n\n(Not pictured in the video: my replaying the lines 85 times trying to get the flow right)\n"

It's been a lovely project, where progress is quite visible, and sharing it is kind of the point. It's also a tool that could be used for content theft, and as such, I will not be releasing it or its source. I have explicit permission from the creator whose content I am using to test and improve these scripts ~~and the compilations themselves of course, I do also just enjoy making them.~~ That *does* give me opportunity to write about it here, though.\n\nHere is a video of YoinkYt running while I still had no UI- the project file was just handwritten json.\n[e](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqJFYRKTWcI) \n\nIt's also slow as balls here.\n\nSince then, I have written the two UI's screenshotted above- for my workflow I prefer the discord bot module. It's right where I need it all the time, and I can just alt+tab, type a very concise command, and be on my way. It generates the project json that I can, through the clip editor GUI for now, directly turn into timestamped clips.\n\nShould I be using json? No. Am I still doing this despite knowing that from the start? Yes. It's not the important part, and ik how to work with it.\n\n### clipping process\n\nYou can totally skip this, it's just the workflow, specifically for the discord bot. For now, a clip / project file needs to be initialized manually: `!>setclipfile <file_name_or_alias> <playlist url>` will do that. A new discord channel is created for a given project. If a clip file is not set, on seeing a clip command, the bot will attempt to use the channel name as an alias, skipping some typing, or some command forgetting-. Alternatively, an existing channel may be used, via `!>setclipfile <file_name_or_alias>` if the file already exists, manually setting the clip file for this channel, for that session.\n\n`clip [index] <timestamp> <duration>` is the verbose format for a clip command. it can be used to specify the video being clipped initially. Index can be implied from the previously clipped video. `clip toggle` toggles clipping mode, which will assume, for that channel, that any message with a colon in its first word is a clip command, reducing typing to `<timestamp> <duration>` for every clip after the first for a given video. The first clip still requires the verbose command. \n\n![concise command in discord](https://i.imgur.com/buA9o2f.png)\n\nlook at it. it's so beautiful. That's a clip. That's going to become a 40 second video file with a timestamp. I typed 8 characters including the space. It still needs to be trimmed manually in a video editor, for comedic timing and audio reasons, but.. that's a decent chunk of the work done for me.\n\nThe gui works pretty much exactly as you'd expect from the screenshot. You can also press enter in a filled textbox to add a new empty timestamp.\n\nRunning it, you kind of just... do that. You throw the project file at YoinkYT, take a nap, and clips have come out."
